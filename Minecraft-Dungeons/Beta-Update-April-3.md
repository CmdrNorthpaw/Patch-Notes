   * [Bugfix] Addressed an issue that could cause the game to stall occasionally
   * [Balance] We've made a number of changes that aim to slightly increase the difficulty of the later stages of the beta, without significantly altering the new player experience:
       * Increased number of mobs in Pumpkin Pastures somewhat
       * Made mobs get staggered from damage slightly less often
       * Slightly increased difficulty of Default V and Default VI
       * Attacking mobs from a distance now alerts nearby unaware mobs
       * Increased the starting arrow count and number of arrows picked up at supply chests, but lowered number of arrows dropped by mobs
