What’s New:

   * We’ve upgraded all the backend stuff that the apps run on, resulting in better performance and fewer bugs.
   * Our spell checker has been swapped out for a newer model that’s faster, leaner, and capable of fixing your typos in… wait, can this be right? “Multiple languages at the same time”! Open the “Language & Region” preferences to choose your languages. And for whoever it is out there requires that functionality: our hats are off to you. We can barely type in one language right now.
