Bug Fixes:

   * Fixed: Windows Action Center notifications were unable to display certain characters, like < or ‘ for example.
   * Fixed: Switching notification types on Windows would cause both types of notifications to be shown until the app was restarted.
   * Fixed: On Windows, if users landed on our error page, the main menu wasn’t available, which was an error in itself. The error on the error page is now de-errored.
   * Fixed: If you zoom way in or zoom way out, and then open the About Slack window, the About Slack window would also be zoomed way in/out, which was a little intense.
   * Fixed: Once in a while, users would receive a flood of notifications for old messages. This was not a bad case of deja vu: it was a bug. And now, a fixed one.
