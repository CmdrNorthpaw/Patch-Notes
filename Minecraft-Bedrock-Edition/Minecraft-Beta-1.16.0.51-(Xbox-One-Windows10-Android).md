PLEASE READ before participating in the Minecraft Beta:

   **Joining the beta will replace your game with a work in progress version of Minecraft
    You will not have access to Realms and will not be able to join non-beta players while you're previewing 
    the beta.
    Any worlds played while in the beta cannot be opened in previous versions of the game so please make 
    copies of worlds to prevent losing them.
    Beta builds can be unstable and are not representative of final version quality
    The beta is available only on Xbox One, Windows 10, and Android (Google Play). 
    To join or leave the beta, see [ms/JoinMCBeta](https://aka.ms/JoinMCBeta) for detailed instructions**
