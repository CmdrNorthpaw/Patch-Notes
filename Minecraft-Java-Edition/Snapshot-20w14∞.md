 Introducing: Snapshot 20w14∞

Technology is amazing – except when it isn’t. Just the other day my own phone ended a call as I was about to order a delicious and completely legit pineapple pizza. And what does Siri mean by “Try selecting a flavor better suited for human consumption”? If this isn’t proof that the singularity is here and that the robot revolution is happening, I don’t know what is.

There are a few exceptions of course (watch it technology, I’ve got my eyes on you), and today Mojang is thrilled to reveal the next big step for Minecraft as we take our game into a bold new direction where no blocky sandbox has gone before. Don’t ask us what direction though, we don’t own a compass and we’re terrible with directions.

Introducing: Snapshot 20w14∞ – the Ultimate Content update.

Stunning, isn’t it? We know. Using aggregated player feedback we have been keeping safe for a long time, combined with highly advanced machine learning, and some random old algorithms we “borrowed” from Dinnerbone’s desk during a recent workshop, we were able to create this Snapshot in which every imaginable reality has become actual reality. And the process for visiting one is quite simple: Just pick up a book, write a few words in it, toss it into a Nether portal, and voila – you now have access to a unique world. Want a world with oceans made out of Creepers? Done! A world where carrots are noteblocks and the sun is an Enderman? Sure, why not. The possibilities are endless.

“Why do I keep getting quoted in these blog posts?” said Jens “Jeb” Bergensten, Chief Creative Officer, as he was unable to contain his excitement for this upcoming Snapshot. “I don’t have time for monkey business, go bother Bartosz instead!”

“We’re literally going bananas right now,“ said Bartosz Bok, Java Developer and overall nice guy. “Not only have we managed to deliver the update our players have always craved – we’ve now completely automated all future content for Minecraft, which means I can finally play the Minecraft Dungeons beta!“

GET THE SNAPSHOT

Snapshots are available for Minecraft: Java Edition. To install the snapshot, open up the Minecraft Launcher and enable snapshots in the "Installations" tab.

**Snapshots can corrupt your world, so please backup and/or run them in a different folder from your main worlds.**

So… no more Snapshots after this?
Well, as this technically means we’ve just introduced all possible update combinations there is, no. But maybe we’ll do a few extras for fun.

Does this Snapshot use blockchain?
What do we look like, SteveCoin?

My dimension doesn’t look like I wanted it to? 
Can we ever be sure of what our true desires are? Reach into your inner sanctum of your mind and try again.

Wait, are those old blocks with different tints? 
LITERALLY. BILLIONS. OF. NEW. BLOCKS!

What about the Nether Update?
Yes.

While we amuse ourselves with the Minecraft Dungeons beta and the new Minecraft Earth updates, we’d love to start cataloging all 2 billion worlds. For that, we will need your help. Send a screenshot of your world to scoops@minecraft.net, along with the message you wrote in your book, and show us what you found. Enjoy your new world!
