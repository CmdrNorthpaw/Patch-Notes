		<p>Valentines Day might have been and gone but there's never a bad time to show some love to our Patch Notes!</p>
		<p>You may have noticed that we have a new look this week. We're changing the way we bring Patch Notes to you. The differences will be small to begin with, designed mainly to make this page feel a little less formal, but eventually we hope to improve the whole format to offer a lot more than we currently do. Got any ideas? Let us know! Links to our forums are a few lines down!</p>

			<p>Semi-active miners were unintentionally impacted by a change to AFK mining rates. To remedy this we have adjusted the rates as follows:</p>

		<li>*100% stamina = 100% damage</li>
		<li>*1-99% stamina = 90% damage</li>
		<li>*0% stamina = 20% damage</li>
		<li>Players only chasing rockertunities should now find their rates similar to before</li>
