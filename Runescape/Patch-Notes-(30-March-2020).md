Archaeology:

Our expert shovelbums have managed to dig up an ancient tome, filled with forgotten wisdom from ages past… oh, hang on, it’s just a regular bunch of changes. Not all of them are directly linked to Archaeology, but they’re all very important for this update to work.


* Changed the ‘Excavate’ option on several objects not connected to Archaeology in order to reduce confusion. Similar changes have been made to Quest Logs and other instructions.
* Added a ‘The Dig Site’ quest icon to all related NPCs, Locations and Objects.
* Various changes to the Make-x interface:
* Reduced the size of the icons on the right-hand panel
* Reduced the size of the text in the 'Values' section
* When selecting a different category, it will no longer show information for an object that hasn't been selected or unlocked
* The clickable/tappable region on the 'Share' options in the Collection Log interface has been increased to cover the entire button.
* Removed the cutscene that plays when entering and exiting the Halls of Camdozaal on Ice Mountain.
* Made numerous improvements to the Collection Log interface:
* Added a 'Reward' info section to each Log
* Increased the click/tap area on the Favourite and Options buttons
* Changed the ambiance on the item backgrounds so obtained items are more identifiable
* Added seven Bank chests to the overworld in all five dig site camps, the Exam Centre and the Archaeology Guild Campus.
* Added 50 new Bank spaces.
* Added a 'Bank deposit' map icon to all Bank deposit locations.
* Added tooltips to items in the Skill Guide.
* Upon levelling up, the Skill Guide will display all the information about each new entry.
* Updated the colour of the Adrenaline Bar to better aid those with colour blindness.
* Removed the Gatherer's Cape from players and returned all shards, as the cape now has an Archaeology requirement.
* Graphically updated Movario.
* Renamed ‘ancient components’ to ‘third-age components’.
* The Max Guild portal’s attunement is now completely independent and no longer checks against the attunements of the portals in War's Retreat.
* Max is now using the 'Jack of Trades' title as he does not own the Archaeology skill pet.
* The mouseover text for a locked Invention material now displays in red.
* Mousing over Achievements will now show your progress towards any Meta Achievements they are included in.
* Added tooltips to the Meta Achievements listed under an Achievement to show what's required. 
  * For example, the tooltip for the ‘Who's The Boss? VI’ Achievement, listed as a requirement for the ‘Final Boss’ Achievement, states ‘Kill a total number of bosses. (X/5,000)’.
* Changed the text in the Skills interface to say 'View Skill Guide' rather than just 'View'.
* Lowered the brightness of the sun over near the Desert Strykewyrms east of Al kharid.

Bugfixes:

No one likes to encounter bugs when they play, so each week we do our best to squash as many as we can!

__*Fixes labelled Hotfix were addressed between weekly releases.*__

* Hotfix: Players can no longer open the Yak Track interface while the First Time User Experience is still active via the Task List or Sir Yaktrick Moore, as doing so caused an issue where blank tasks were displayed on the interface.
* Hotfix: Players can now hand in eggs to Benedict regardless of how much of Benedict’s World Tour has been completed.
* Fixed an issue where the message played after unlocking the 15th Anniversary skilling speech bubbles pointed to the incorrect tab within Game Settings.
* Fixed numerous graphical bugs surrounding the new Dig Site entrances and the Archaeology Guild Campus.
* Fixed an issue where the Gizmo interface would not repopulate the potential outcomes when dragging a material out of the grid area.
* Fixed an issue where the spacer wasn't showing between some of the requirements in the Make-x interface.
* The thumbs of certain Dig Site employees have been returned to their proper size.
