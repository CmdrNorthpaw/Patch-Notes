Valentines Day might have been and gone but there's never a bad time to show some love to our Patch Notes!

You may have noticed that we have a new look this week. We're changing the way we bring Patch Notes to you. The differences will be small to begin with, designed mainly to make this page feel a little less formal, but eventually we hope to improve the whole format to offer a lot more than we currently do. Got any ideas? Let us know! Links to our forums are a few lines down!

Once Upon a Slime:

Have you helped King Slime find love yet? It's not too late!

    King Slime's Top Hat now appears at the start of the newest list within the player wardrobe.
    Fixed a typo that occurs in the Once Upon A Slime quest.
    Completing the quest will now allow players to re-equip their Comp Capes without having to log back in.

Combat:

Death can be difficult to work with, even at the best of times.

    Players can no longer receive the first two bosses from Elite Dungeons as Reaper assignments.
    Fixed a bug that allowed players' to walk inside the portals.

Mining:

Semi-active miners were unintentionally impacted by a change to AFK mining rates. To remedy this we have adjusted the rates as follows:

    *100% stamina = 100% damage
    *1-99% stamina = 90% damage
    *0% stamina = 20% damage
    Players only chasing rockertunities should now find their rates similar to before

Other:

    Pushed a number of server-side optimisations and futureproofing measures for Diango's item storage.
    The Winter Chill off has now been removed from the Lumbridge Crater.
    The uncompressed textures setting has been re-enabled.

No one likes encounter bugs when they play, so each week we do our best to squash as many as we can!
