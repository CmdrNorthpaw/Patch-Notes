You may have noticed that we have a new look this week. We're changing the way we bring Patch Notes to you. The differences will be small to begin with, designed mainly to make this page feel a little less formal, but eventually we hope to improve the whole format to offer a lot more than we currently do. Got any ideas? Let us know! Links to our forums are a few lines down!
