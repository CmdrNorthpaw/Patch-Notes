Player Tutorials

Remember Tutorial Island? That nostalgic little islet is the first thing most players see when they first step foot in Gielinor, and we want to make sure the things you learn there (and elsewhere) are as helpful as possible. With that in mind, we've made the following changes.
A tutorial pop-up to teach default interaction now appears after character creation if the player doesn't move from the starting coordinate for a while after arrival on the mainland.
A two-step tutorial pop-up to teach camera zoom and rotation controls now appears after the default interaction popup, or after the player's first conversation with Turael during the First Time User Experience - as long as these controls haven't previously been taught or have otherwise been cancelled.
The Click/Tap to Continue button now flashes in the player's first mainland conversation, instead of just the first conversation with the RuneScape Guide on Tutorial Island.
The Loot All button is now highlighted the first time the player picks up multiple items with area loot.
A brief tutorial for the Loot window and the Backpack now appears when first picking up an item, if guidance system hints are enabled.
Levelling up is now introduced the first time a new player gains a level in any skill, if guidance system hints are enabled.
Moving via the Minimap is now introduced when the player starts being directed away from the Burthorpe lodestone, if this wasn't taught on Tutorial Island.
New players on the Burthorpe First Time User Experience that leave the Burthorpe & Taverley area are now informed of the lodestone network, so they know how to return to a safe hub.
The tutorial pop-up that previously only occurred when starting the Blood Pact quest now occurs when starting your first quest.
A "Tell me about the skills menu" dialogue option has been added to all skill tutors.
A list of repeatable tutorials is now available from Turael, Major Mary Rancour and the Lumbridge Sage. This includes several topics salvaged from Tutorial Island, such as the Financial Advisor's introduction to the economy, and the Quest Guide's introduction to the quest list.
Diango

Diango and his store have undergone some further work this week.
'Skill Sets' are now displayed while hovering over the skill tab in the Diango interface.
Brain Plushies can now be retrieved from Diango.
The player is no longer able to retrieve infinite copies of the Warlock Outfit from Diango's store.
Items in the last column of Diango's interface are no longer sliced when resizing the Bank interface.
When you drag the Witch's Plushie item out from the bank, it now confirms it can be reclaimed from Diango.
Fixed an issue that was blocking users from reclaiming Rare Item Tokens from Diango if they had existing tokens in other inventories (Backpack/Bank/Currency Pouch)
Fixed an issue where some outfits could not be retrieved from the Diango storage.
Other
Dialogue has been added to the Mini Morn pet.
Har-Aken in the Fight Kiln will no longer dive immediately when you do over 10k damage in a single hit, making the fight less frustrating for high level players.
The Sing for the Lady Achievement now lists the full requirements.
Empty text space has been removed when examining "clue scrolls" or "clue caskets" held within "Charos' Clue Carrier"
Magic notepaper now works on a polypore stick.
Magic notepaper can now be used on clean irit.
Imps in the God Wars Dungeon will now count towards demon Slayer tasks.
Getting damaged by the Gorak now lowers your Invention level.
Player is now informed that mummies can only be harmed by fire when attacking them at the end of Desert Treasure.
Unlocking expertise will no longer pop-up when buying new sigil abilities.
Removed Harlan's dialogue relating to the combat academy.
Christmas Pudding Amulet has had its 'Destroy' option altered to be more consistent.
Hetty will now only take one burnt meat during the Witch's Potion miniquest.
Sacred clay hatchets are now correctly marked as level 50 in the skill guide.
Bugfixes

No one likes to encounter bugs when they play, so each week we do our best to squash as many as we can!

Fixes labelled Hotfix were addressed between weekly releases.
Hotfix: Unblocked the path between Burthorpe's military training camp and the nearby All Fired Up beacon.

You are now able to attack spiritual warriors in your own Player Owned Dungeon.
Huge and large lamps no longer display as being useable in F2P worlds.
Fixed a minor exploit when fighting the Hardcore Giant Mole.

You can no longer use telekinetic grab on bloodwood logs.
The correct amount of Combat XP is now given when defeating Kal'ger the Warmonger in Daemonheim.

Transitions between the "What is your experience with RuneScape?" prompt, Tutorial Island, and Burthorpe arrival have been improved to better mask the toplevel interface.
The Burthorpe area logo has been added to the Burthorpe arrival cutscene to better illustrate the meaning of the "Burthorpe" overlay text.
Achievement and path popups/messaging/fireworks for completing Tutorial Island no longer occur when transitioning to Burthorpe for the first time.
An issue where Quest Points were not calculated during the first login session, and therefore failed to count the Quest Point awarded for the Learning the Ropes tutorial until the next login has been fixed.
Drilling soldiers in the Burthorpe imperial guard camp are now dormant when there are no players nearby for better processing efficiency.
Cooking crayfish during the Burthorpe First Time User Experience now describes the act with a similar level of mechanical detail as cooking shrimp on Tutorial Island.
Updated the Minimap image that accompanies the bluebox highlighting tutorial, as it predated the 2014 map icon rework.
The World Map and lodestone network can no longer be opened when most UI tutorials are active, to prevent conflicts.
White Wolf Mountain is no longer classified as part of Burthorpe, so that a new player can be appropriately warned they are leaving the starting zone before encountering dangerous wolves.
Known Issues

We do our best, but sometimes things slip through the net. These are the bugs we're currently aware of.
The ring that denotes how close you are to being caught during Big Game Hunter does not currently change colour like it should.

Another great selection of improvements and fixes from the team this week, which we hope you'll love as much as we do!

Wondering where our Ninjas are this week? Well frankly, so are we! Those sneaky devs have alluded us this week, but we have it on good authority that it won't be long until they strike again! Be sure to check back next week in case they make a dash from the shadows.

Until next time!
