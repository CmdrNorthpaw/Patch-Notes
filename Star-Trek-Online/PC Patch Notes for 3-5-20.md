    * Players must have completed their faction’s Tutorial, and chosen a primary Allegiance (if applicable) before being able to participate in the Event version of this content. 
    
Rewards:
    
   * All players may complete the Battle at the Binary Stars FTFO in order to earn their Daily Progress once every 20 hours, in addition to TFO’s standard rewards.
   *  Earn a total of 14 days’ worth of Daily Progress to become eligible to claim all of these rewards:
      * Universal Kit Module – DOT-7 Drone Fabrication (and Account-Wide Unlock for Reclaim).
      * DOT-7 Non-Combat Drone (and Account-Wide Unlock for Reclaim).
      * 25,000 Dilithium Ore (once only).
      * 3x Featured TFO Reward Boxes (once only).
         * Each gives a choice of 1x Specialization Point or an Enhanced Universal Tech Upgrade.

Bonus Rewards:
            After claiming the Grand Prize, you will unlock the option of earning additional Dilithium Ore each day, beginning at 8,000 Dilithium Ore for the first day’s completion.
            Earning Bonus Progress each day thereafter will increase this reward by an additional 1,000, and we have increased the cap on how high this value may scale to a value that is unreachable during this Event (thus effectively unlimited!).
            All Bonus Progress Rewards are rewarded a maximum of once per day, per account, and are immediately and automatically granted to the active character when the requirement is met.
        Zen Buyout Option:
            For players interested in instantly completing the Battle at the Binary Stars FTFO event, we will be offering an updated method for buying out.
                Within the new Event UI, an option will be presented that allows you to purchase the remaining progress that you need, for a scaling amount of Zen.
        A Second Chance:
            Progress after the Event has ended will remain in an all new Second Chance interface, allowing the option to buyout rewards long after the Event has expired.
    DOT-7 Drones:
        Players that completed this Featured Event will be rewarded with two different methods of summoning their own DOT-7 Drones:
        Universal Kit Module – DOT-7 Drone Fabrication:
            This kit module fabricates a DOT-7 Utility Drone that will follow and assist you.
            It will periodically attempt to cripple the damage resistance, damage output, and/or movement speed of nearby enemies by using Fuse Armor and/or Weapons Malfunction.
        DOT-7 Non-Combat Drone (Vanity Pet):
            This automated replica is only equipped with the most basic AI subroutines and should be incapable of causing issues even when exposed to hostile technology.
            Obtaining these rewards on any character on your account will unlock the ability to reclaim each of them on other characters, via the Reclaim Store within the Events UI.
                You may only reclaim this item on characters that do not already own one.

Legacy Progress:

    Veteran players that have participated in previous Featured TFOs may still be in possession of multiple “Featured TFO Commendation” items, which are no longer used in the new Event System.
    Players that still have these will be able to turn them in for Daily Progress and Event Campaign Progress.
        Each upcoming eligible event will have an option to Apply Legacy Progress to the requirements present.
    For those of you who had past Featured TFO projects still slotted in the old Event Reputation UI, those projects will be auto-completed, granting you the rewards.
