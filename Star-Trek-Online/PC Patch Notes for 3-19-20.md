General:

   * Resolved an issue that would sometimes cause item names to not appear in various stores.
   * Duty Officer Pack Updates:
      *  Removed the Reinforcements pack from the Duty Officer tab
      *  Changed the price of the Gamma, Delta, Romulan, and Fleet Duty Officer Packs to 300 ZEN
      *  Added an Uncommon and Rare Duty Officer to each of the 4 themed packs mentioned above so they give out 4 common, 3 uncommon, and 1 rare along with their bonus item.
          *  These have a chance for a higher quality so you should never see more than 4 common and you should always get 9 Duty Officers total.
    * Moved the bonus prize in the Gamma pack of 4 fleet modules out and replaced it with the Tuffli Class Freighter.
    * Removed the 4 Fleet Module Rewards from the Delta Pack which increases the chance at winning the traits as a bonus reward.
    * Created a Duty Officer bundle which has 1 of each of the 4 themed doff packs in them for a discounted price.

 
Systems:

   * Removed the EC cost associated with altering the Name and Registry of player starships.
