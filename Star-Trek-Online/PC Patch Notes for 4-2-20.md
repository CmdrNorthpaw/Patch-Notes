First Contact Day Celebration!

   * Join us for the First Contact Day Celebration starting on PC on April 2nd, 2020 and continuing until April 23rd, 2020.
   * The First Contact Day Event can be accessed through Star Trek Online’s recently released Events Tab.
   * Two ways to earn Event Progress! Compete with four other players to build and launch your very own Phoenix Rocket, or join Seven-of-Nine and travel back to April 4th, 2063, and participate in a brand new patrol surrounding the titular event.
   * Captains that earn 14 or more Daily Progress may then claim Event Grand Prize – a Temporal Vortex Probe (Universal Console).

   * New Event Patrol: One Night in Bozeman
       * Included with the traditional model rocket building First Contact Day TFO, Captains will be able to participate in a brand-new patrol, “One Night in Bozeman”.
       * Access this limited-time content through the Event UI, or the Patrols Tab of the PvE UI.
       * The Borg have altered the timeline to ensure that they succeed in their previously-foiled plan to stop First Contact between Earth and Vulcan.
       * Team up with Seven-of-Nine and discover what The Borg have done to alter the timeline, and then do everything you can to correct it.

 

   * First Contact Day Event Rewards:
       * First Contact Day Badge Box:
           * Completing either of the participating activities once per day, per account, will earn you a First Contact Day Badge Box.
           * Opening this box will grant players the opportunity to choose between 17 never-before-released Comm Badges as account-wide unlocks.
       * First Contact Day Event Grand Prize:

                   * Inspired by Borg technology, this probe is capable of opening a dangerously unstable Temporal Vortex that can travel through local space to damage and debilitate enemy vessels in the area.
                   * The drone will travel toward the targeted foe's current location, dragging the anomaly with it while emitting chroniton radiation in a large cone facing away from its trajectory.
                   * This console also provides a passive boost to Exotic Damage and Cooldown Reduction for Temporal Operative Bridge Officer Abilities, as well as a scaling bonus to Turn Speed that scales with Auxiliary Power.
