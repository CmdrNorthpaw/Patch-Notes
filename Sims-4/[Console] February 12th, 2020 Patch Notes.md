Just a small update this time to address a couple of issues and enable the Maxis Curated filter on console. Not really a lot more to say so… erm… Here we go...

**General Issues:**

  * Fixed some crashes that were occurring in Build Mode
  *  The Maxis Curated filter in The Gallery will show the creations that have been carefully selected and reviewed and put in the spotlight.
  *  We noticed that the pack detail pages weren’t showing pricing and sale information unless you went to the store pages. Now you can review the pricing information for the packs without leaving the game.
