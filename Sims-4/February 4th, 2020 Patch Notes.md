Twenty years ago, The Sims was released on the 4th of February 2000. As a simulation game, it confused "traditional" gamers because it had no defined end goals and there was no way to "win." Non-players even described it as "that game where you have to tell your character to use the bathroom." Even now, two decades later, some people have yet to abandon this mindset, but many of you have been with us from the beginning or joined in the years between, and you understand why The Sims is so much more than just playing house.

Thank you for being here with us through this journey. We have been working on bringing new experiences to our players, such as cross-platform Gallery for our console, PC, and Mac players. And as we continue through our twentieth year, we hope to deliver new excitement to the world of The Sims.

To start the celebrations, we added the Birthday Hot Tub, which you can find in Build Buy as soon as you update your game. Yes, it is for everyone!

We also added new music--we hope you enjoy it!
